# Neovim lua config

Clone into `./config/nvim/`, or wherever your Neovim config is.

Heavily based off [ThePrimeagen's init.lua](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua) and [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

Contains [which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) that can help with the key mapping, do `:WhichKey` or wait for a few seconds after a key press for the menu to show up. Or alternatively, if searching for a key mapping do `:Telescope keymaps`.
